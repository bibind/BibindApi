"""Basic HttpCase tests for bibind_website_public.

The tests rely on Odoo's testing framework. They are skipped automatically if
Odoo is not installed in the execution environment. This allows the test suite
of this kata repository to run without pulling the heavy Odoo dependency while
still providing meaningful examples for real deployments.
